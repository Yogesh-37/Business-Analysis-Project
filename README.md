# Atlys-payment-automation
Atlys is a US-based online visa-processing platform that offers simplified visa services for over 120+ countries.

Payments sometimes fail on the Atlys platform.
Refund bot requires a clean list of failed payments but is currently fed cases manually.

Use MySQL to identify failed payments and produce an export-ready CSV for the refund bot.
Create a simple schema (users, employees, orders, payments, refunds) and write SQL queries (JOINS, SUBQUERIES, CASE, COALESCE, GROUP BY/HAVING) to identify failed payments and prepare a CSV feed for the refund bot.
