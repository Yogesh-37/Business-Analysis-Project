# Project Overview

ElectricPe operates Mobility Centres that connect customers to top electric 2-wheeler brands. 
ElectricPe wanted to understand where leads were dropping across the Lead to Delivery funnel and identify operational bottlenecks affecting conversions, delivery speed, cancellations, and customer satisfaction.

# Goal:

Design a Advance Excel-based project that:
- Analyze end-to-end store operations
- Build an interactive Excel dashboard
- Identify bottlenecks and provide actionable recommendations
- Follow a structured flow: Data → Insights → Recommendations → Impact

# Data Overview

Dataset included 1,000+ leads:

- Leads, Pre-bookings, Bookings, Deliveries
- Store-level TAT (Turnaround Time)
- Cancellation reasons
- Lead quality (Hot / Warm / Cold)
- Customer ratings for NPS calculation

# Analysis Performed (Excel)
